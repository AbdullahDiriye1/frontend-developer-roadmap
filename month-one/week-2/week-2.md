# Installation, and more

## Selecting an Editor

An editor is where you are going to type in your code. It’s sort of like the equivalent of Microsoft Word to a writer.

You’ll need to download an editor. I love using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) but there are a ton of options out there like Atom, Sublime or Pycharm.

Here’s an [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-choose-a-text-editor-for-javascript-ec75c2cee6b8/) about editors and how you can pick one.

## Terminal

If you have a mac, you already have a terminal. You can open it up on a mac right away and start to use it! I personally love using [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/).

If you want to go more in depth, you can read about [command line basics](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics).

### Assignment: Select and download an editor
- [ ] Decide what editor you want to use
- [ ] Download the editor and poke around in it a little
- [ ] Create a new file using your chosen editor

## Git and GitHub

You’re going to have to get familiar with Git and Github. These sound intimidating but you don’t have to go too into depth yet!

Here’s a quick guide about [Git]((http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)).

And here's a [video](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-crash-course/) crash course on Git if that helps you more!
