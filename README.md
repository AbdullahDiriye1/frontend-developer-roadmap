# Frontend Developer Roadmap

## About

Learning how to code is hard. Knowing where to start is even harder.

When I started out, I had no idea what resources I should use. I wasted most of my time just trying to figure out what resources I should use.

This is a curated resource and ongoing project to help aspiring developers know where to start on their journey to becoming a frontend developer.

You might need to go through weeks faster or slower depending on the time you have to commit. The time that one person takes to complete this will differ from someone else and that is totaly ok!

I'm open to PR's and suggestions!

## Week One - Start with the Basics

I think it's important to have some wins right off the bat. Instead of downloading a ton of stuff and seeing the benefits from that hours/days from now, we're going to jump right in with some coding.

You’re going to dive into HTML, CSS, and JS by completing a few freeCodeCamp modules.

Go to https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn and let’s get started.

### HTML

// TODO intro about HTML

### Assignments: Complete the following modules
- [ ] [Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)
- [ ] [Say Hello to HTML elements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/say-hello-to-html-elements)
- [ ] [Headline with the H2 element](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/headline-with-the-h2-element)
- [ ] [Introduction to HTML5 elements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/introduction-to-html5-elements)
- [ ] [Add Images to your website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/add-images-to-your-website)
- [ ] [Link to external pages with anchor elements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/link-to-external-pages-with-anchor-elements)

Ok awesome. If you want to go on and complete more of the HTML freeCodeCamp certificate, that’s great. If not, we can keep going.

### CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets,

Let’s now learn a little about CSS.

Here’s a very thorough guide, a [free CSS handbook!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-css-handbook-a-handy-guide-to-css-for-developers-b56695917d11/)

This is a super long [video](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-in-this-free-6-hour-video-course/) but if you want to learn more about CSS, you can watch some of it maybe while you cook some dinner!

// TODO - Do some CSS sections from free code camp

Next, let’s learn a little bit about JavaScript.

### JavaScript

// TODO - get some javascript intro materials

Additional JavaScript resources that I reccommend:
//  TODO

### Assignment: Complete the following JavaScript freeCodeCamp lessons
- [ ] [Declare javascript variables](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/declare-javascript-variables)
- [ ] [Storing values with the assignment operator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/storing-values-with-the-assignment-operator)
- [ ] [Initializing variables with the assignment operator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/initializing-variables-with-the-assignment-operator)
- [ ] [Add two numbers with Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/add-two-numbers-with-javascript)
- [ ] []

Great. I really just wanted you to get started with some coding to show you some of the cool stuff you can do as a frontend developer.

Running code in the browser through freeCodeCamp or CodePen is great. But you’ll need to start running code on your computer as a developer. We'll work on that next
