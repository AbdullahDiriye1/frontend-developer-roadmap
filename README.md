# Zero to Developer - Frontend Roadmap

## About

Learning how to code is hard. Knowing where to start is even harder.

When I started out, I had no idea what resources I should use. I wasted most of my time just trying to find tutorials. I would start a tutorial and worry I wasn't learning enough from that tutorial so I would switch to another one.

I spent a year teaching myself to code (and even attending a bootcamp towards the end!) and I wasted a lot of time.

So many people have been reaching out to me and sharing their struggles - the same pain points that I had.

One struggle that I also had was that I learn by building. But some people learn by reading or watching videos. And it was really hard for me to cobble together resources at the time. I think everyone learns differently so I want to provide different ways of learning in each week.

This is a curated resource (and ongoing project) to help aspiring developers know where to start on their journey to becoming a frontend developer.

Each week, I'll add more material, challenges, and resources.

You might need to go through weeks faster or slower depending on the time you have to commit. The time that one person takes to complete this will differ from someone else and that is totaly ok!

I'm open to PR's and suggestions!
